# Clipify

Clipify is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload video files and extract audio or create video clips based on a specified duration. It provides a simple interface for generating both full audio extractions and segmented audio/video clips.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Run Instructions

### 0. FFmpeg Installation (Windows)
For the video processing to work, FFmpeg must be installed and accessible via your system's PATH. Follow these steps to install it on Windows:

1.  **Download FFmpeg:**
    *   Go to the official FFmpeg builds page: [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
    *   Download the latest `ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip` (or similar latest build).

2.  **Extract and Place FFmpeg:**
    *   Extract the downloaded `.zip` file.
    *   Create a new folder named `ffmpeg` directly under your `C:` drive (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`).
    *   Copy the contents of the `bin` folder (from the extracted FFmpeg zip, it should contain `ffmpeg.exe`, `ffprobe.exe`, `ffplay.exe`) into `C:\ffmpeg`.

3.  **Add FFmpeg to System PATH:**
    *   Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows Start menu and select "Edit the system environment variables."
    *   In the System Properties window, click the "Environment Variables..." button.
    *   Under the "System variables" section, find and select the `Path` variable, then click "Edit...".
    *   Click "New" and add `C:\ffmpeg` to the list.
    *   Click "OK" on all open windows to save the changes.

4.  **Verify Installation:**
    *   Open a **new** Command Prompt or PowerShell window (it must be a new one for changes to take effect).
    *   Type `ffmpeg -version` and press Enter.
    *   You should see FFmpeg version information. If you see `'ffmpeg' is not recognized...`, double-check the previous steps.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd clipify
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
- **Frontend:**
  ```bash
  cd client && npm install
  ```
- **Backend:**

  cd ../server && npm install
  ```
- **Processor:**
  ```bash
  cd ../processor && pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 3. Run Locally
- **Frontend:**
  ```bash
  cd client && npm start
  ```
- **Backend:**
  ```bash
  cd server && npm start
  ```
- **Processor:**
  (Runs automatically when called by backend)

### 4. Docker (Optional)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## üöÄ Usage
1.  Open the frontend in your browser (`http://localhost:3000`).
2.  Drag and drop your video file into the designated area.
3.  Choose your processing options:
    *   **Clip Duration:** Specify the length of individual video/audio clips (in seconds). This option is disabled when "Full Video Audio" is selected.
    *   **Audio Only:** Check this to extract audio instead of video.
        *   **Clipped Audio:** Generates multiple audio clips based on the `Clip Duration`.
        *   **Full Video Audio:** Extracts the entire audio from the video as a single MP3 file.
4.  Click "Process" to start the upload and processing. Monitor the progress bar.
5.  Once processing is complete, your generated clips will appear below. You can download individual clips or click "Download All" to get a zip archive of all clips from the latest process.
